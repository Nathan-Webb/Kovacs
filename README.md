# Kovacs
Named after the last envoy.

This is just a mod bot with your run of the mill generic mod commands. It has a few anti-unicode and anti-hoisting features. The real power in this is the [On-Sight](https://github.com/Nathan-Webb/Kovacs/wiki/AutoMod) automoderation and a unique [permission system](https://github.com/Nathan-Webb/Kovacs/wiki/Permissions) alongside a rich [configuration system](https://github.com/Nathan-Webb/Kovacs/wiki/Config).

Something to keep me productive during the quarantine I guess.

This is built for one or two servers (hence the very rudimentary config). I may consider expanding and using an actual database such as MongoDB if I wish to expand. However steps would need to be taken to ensure clarity in terms of necessary permissions and if moderation actions can be taken by the bot in certain situations.
