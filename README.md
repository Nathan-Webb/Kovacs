# Kovacs
Named after the last envoy.

This is just a mod bot with your run of the mill generic mod commands. It has a few anti-unicode and anti-hoisting features. The real power in this is the [On-Sight](https://github.com/Nathan-Webb/Kovacs/wiki/AutoMod) automoderation and a unique [permission system](https://github.com/Nathan-Webb/Kovacs/wiki/Permissions) alongside a rich [configuration system](https://github.com/Nathan-Webb/Kovacs/wiki/Config).

Something to keep me productive during the quarantine I guess.
